Welcome to Lychrel's documentation!
===================================

**Lychrel** is a high-performance Python library implementing fascinating mathematical problems and algorithms,
named after the mysterious `lychrel numbers <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lychrel_number>`_.

The library combines the elegance and ease of Python with the performance of Rust, using PyO3 to provide
Python bindings to highly optimized Rust implementations. This approach delivers:

* üöÄ **Exceptional Performance**: 20-50x faster than pure Python implementations
* üî¢ **Arbitrary Precision**: Handle numbers of any size using Rust's BigInt
* üêç **Pythonic Interface**: Natural and intuitive API for Python developers
* üì¶ **Zero Dependencies**: No external Python packages required
* ‚úÖ **Production Ready**: Comprehensive test coverage and type hints

.. note::

   This project is under active development. Contributions and feedback are always welcome!

What's Inside
-------------

The library currently implements five fascinating mathematical algorithms:

**Lychrel Numbers**
   Explore the reverse-and-add algorithm and discover Lychrel candidates‚Äînumbers that may never form palindromes.

**Generalized Fibonacci Sequences**
   Compute terms in Lucas sequences, generalizations of the famous Fibonacci sequence including Pell numbers and more.

**Kaprekar's Routine**
   Apply Kaprekar's mysterious algorithm that leads to the constant 6174 for 4-digit numbers.

**Look-and-Say Sequence**
   Generate Conway's audioactive decay sequence by "reading out loud" the digits of a number.

**Collatz Conjecture**
   Explore the famous 3n+1 problem‚Äîone of mathematics' most intriguing unsolved conjectures.

Quick Start
-----------

Installation is simple:

.. code-block:: console

   pip install lychrel

Then start exploring:

.. code-block:: python

   import lychrel

   # Check for Lychrel candidates
   print(lychrel.is_lychrel_candidate(196))  # True

   # Compute Fibonacci numbers
   print(lychrel.fibonacci(10))  # 55

   # Apply Kaprekar's routine
   print(lychrel.kaprekar(1234))  # 6174

   # Generate Collatz sequence
   print(lychrel.collatz(27))  # [27, 82, 41, ..., 2, 1]
